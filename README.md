*Dragon War** is a high-energy, voice-interactive improv game show built as the final project of the Murf AI 10-Day Voice Agent Challenge.   The AI acts as the dramatic, witty host of *Improv Battle: Dragon War Edition*, guiding the player through multiple short-form improv scenes and reacting to their performance.
